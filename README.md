i'm q1ko (kiko)

- i am a university student studying cyber security and mathematics
- i work on projects involving the games i play
- i am exploring on using different api's, particularly transport networks

- since i use discord a lot, many of my projects are discord bots through python
- i also know java

feel free to contact me on discord: kiko#0770
though when you do, tell me you're from github!
i get the occasional messages from bots
